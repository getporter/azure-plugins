## Install

The plugins are distributed as a single binary, `azure`. The following snippet will clone this repository, build the binary
and install it to **~/.porter/plugins/**.

```
go get get.porter.sh/plugin/azure
cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/get.porter.sh/plugin/azure
make build install
```

After installing the plugin, you must modify your porter configuration file and select which plugin you want to use.

## Instance Storage

Instance Storage plugins allow Porter to store a record of installed bundles in a remote location.

### Blob

The `instance-storage.azure.blob` plugin stores records of your bundle instances in Azure Blob Storage. 

1. Open, or create, `~/.porter/config.toml`.
1. Add the following line to instruct Porter to use the azure blob storage plugin

    ```toml
    instance-storage-plugin = "azure.blob"
    ```

1. [Create a storage account][account]
1. [Create a container][container] named `porter`.
1. [Copy the connection string][connstring] for the storage account. Then set it as an environment variable named 
    `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`.
